# Individual Developer -- Participant #

A developer working as a participant in a group project needs to learn how to communicate with others, and uses these commands in additioin to the ones needed by a standalone developer.

 - `git-clone` from the upstream to prime your local repository.
 - `git-pull` and `git-fetch` from "origin" to keep up-to-date with the upstream.
 - `git-push` to shared repository, if you adopt CVS style shared repository workflow.
 - `git-format-patch` to prepare e-mail submission, if you adopt Linux kernel-style public forum workflow.
 - `git-send-email` to send your e-mail submission without corruption by your MUA.
 - `git-request-pull` to create a summary of changes for your upstream to pull.
